# Furniture Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the prices of furniture items based on various features using machine learning algorithms. It demonstrates the application of regression techniques in a retail or e-commerce environment.

## Dataset

The dataset includes furniture product information such as:
- Category
- Material
- Size or dimensions
- Brand
- Ratings
- Historical price data

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Regression model building and evaluation
- Predictive analytics for price estimation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/furniture-price-prediction.git
   cd furniture-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "furniture price prediction.ipynb"
   ```

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was measured using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
